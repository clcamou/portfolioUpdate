      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" width="200" height="200" Align=left alt="Christine Camou" class="rounded">

      <p>I am a middle school math teacher at the Math and Science Success Academy. I have been teaching for the last
        five years, which has honed my skills in time management, problem-solving, creativity, flexibility, and
        interpersonal skills. If I can successfully teach a class of more than 50 students in a portable classroom in
        the parking lot of a school or outside on the recess benches in the middle of a construction zone, I can tackle
        any project, problem or task throw my way.</p>

      <p> In addition to my duties as a math teacher, I coach the Science Olympiad team, the Robotics team, mentor three
        new teachers, and run the math department. These additional duties have helped shape my ability to both lead a
        team and to work collaboratively within a team.</p>

      <p> I am currently completely a coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona in order to become more knowledgeable
        about skills that are necessary to succeed in order to provide a higher quality of education to my students.</p>
